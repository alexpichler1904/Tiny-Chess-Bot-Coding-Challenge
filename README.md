Almost all of the code is written by Sebastian Lague (https://www.youtube.com/@SebastianLague).
The only file I have written is "src/My Bot/MyBot.cs".
I have written it as part of a coding challenge by Sebastian Lague (https://youtu.be/iScy18pVR58?si=Dn_ryMYWYjEWwGWT).
After running the code, you can play against my engine by selecting "Human vs MyBot", you can let my engine play itsself by selecting "MyBot vs MyBot" or you can select "MyBot vs EvilBot" and let my engine play against a bot that just plays random moves.
